The app starts with the list of insurance plans that users can go through with all the details mentioned and their benefits. The insurance plans could vary according to current age and financial status. If the user likes a particular insurance plan then he/she can apply for it by logging into the system, then pass through the payment gateway. The user has to upload his image, age proof and other required documents. The moderator gets access to the documents of a client through web application. When insurance is confirmed to the client, he receives an app notification as well a mail on his registered emailID. There is a reminder that enables the user for on time payment every month.
